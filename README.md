# Basket-Kata

It is interesting going from an event based way of thinking back to pure OO.
I have assumed that the consumer of the classes will add a voucher or item to the basket 1 at a time and on any change it will recalculate the total 


Product category needs more items in it. posible open closed violation because new categories have to be added manually

I wasinitally confused by the Hat product, I assumed this was headgear but looking closely at the scenarios i reallised that it wasn't
